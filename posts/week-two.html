<h3 class="question">What did I do this past week?</h3>
<div class="answer">
  This past week I mostly worked on my compilers homework which is not too bad
  except for the part about Integers and Float parsing with scientific notation.
   I also attended the kickoff meeting for CSRoadshow because I want to
   participate in a CS outreach program. In addition to school work, I also pan
   fried chicken for the first time which turned out pretty decent for my first
   time frying something ever.

<h3 class="question">What's in my way?</h3>
<div class="answer">
  The number one thing that is in my way is finding quicker recipes to cook so
  that I have more time to do other things. I also find that procrastination is
  getting to me already so early in the semester and it is definitely a habit
  that I have to break sooner rather than later. Another thing in my way is
  having a Windows PC, a lot of development tools are not designed for Windows,
  so even if there is a port, it is not executed the same way as the original.
  For example, I had installed 'Gnu Make' for windows so that if I developed C
  code I could compile it using a makefile, but the command that it uses is
  "mingw32-make" which I aliased to 'make' so that it would function the same
  as make. A lot of extra work for something simple, but that's Windows for you.

<h3 class="question">What will I do next week?</h3>
<div class="answer">
  This upcomming week I will start working on the first Collatz project. I
  already have some Python coding experience so I feel this assignment should
  not be that complicated. The hard part will be to use all of the workflow
  tools that Downing has us using, as I have never used a lot of those features
  before.

<h3 class="question">What's my experience with the class?</h3>
<div class="answer">
  I really like the class so far. I love the conversations that Downing has with
  each student that benefits the whole class. I also like that during class
  Downing takes notes, so that we essentially don't have to. It allows me to pay
  attention more in class rather than worrying about missing information. The

<h3 class="question">What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h3>
<div class="answer">
  My pick-of-the-week is <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">Flask</a>.
  Flask is a micro web framework written in Python that is very useful for
  creating web server architecture with Python as the backend. I've used it this
  weekend to create a web application to scrape data from the university dining
  hall menus and present the data in a much more useful view than what the
  university has to offer(in my opinion). Check it out

<h3 class="question">What's my experience with the class?</h3>
<div class="answer">
I like the idea of "Cold-Calling" which aides in the interaction between
professor and student. I have never had a class do that before so I am
intereseted in seeing how it plays out throughout the semester.

<h3 class="question">What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h3>
<div class="answer">
My pick-of-the-week is <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a>. It is the code editor
made by Github, so it interacts nicely there, and has many plugins that are
useful. I am using atom to write this blog currently and have used it in many other
CS classes as a universal text editor.

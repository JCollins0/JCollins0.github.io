<h3 class="question">What did I do this past week?</h3>

<div class="answer">
  This past week, I turned in most of my class projects. I also spent a lot of
  time getting ready for Career Fair. I updated my resume, worked on other
  classwork so that I could allow for all of my Thursday to be devoted to the
  FOCS brunch and Career Fair. I also had the wonderful experience of trying
  to connect to my roommate's printer so that I could print my resumes.

<h3 class="question">What's in my way?</h3>

<div class="answer">
  The main thing in my way is my Theory of Interest class. The professor
  insists on being right all of the time, so even when she makes a mistake, she
  has to be right. It makes me frustrated; I love math, but the professor's
  attitude is making it less fun. I have a test next week in Theory of Interest
  and finding the time and motivation to study for the test is slowly fading.
</div>

<h3 class="question">What will I do next week?</h3>

<div class="answer">
  Next week I will be working on my second compilers project. I only have one
  week to do it, so hopefully it is easier than the first assignment. I also
  have two tests next week, so studying for those tests will take up most of my
  week. As for entertainment, I'm planning to see Ocean's 8 at the Union movie
  theater. I love that UT Events and Entertainment exists and puts on free
  movies every week.

<h3 class="question">What was your experience of Project #1?</h3>

<div class="answer">
  The complexity of Project #1 was overall not that bad. The problem was pretty
  easy to solve especially in python. The hardest part was going through the
  workflow checklist vigorously to make sure that I hadn't forgoten or skipped
  any steps. Making issues on GitLab definitely helped with not forgetting any
  steps. I know that the workflow was a little overkill for Collatz, but it
  will definitely be useful for the group project later on, as there will be
  way more stuff to do.

<h3 class="question">What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h3>

<div class="answer">
  My pick of the week is <a href="https://www.texstudio.org/">TexStudio</a>.
  TexStudio is a LaTeX editor that has auto complete, an integrated PDF viewer,
  spell checking, word frequency checking, inline formula previewing, syntax
  highlighting, and much much more. I find TexStudio to be better than most
  editors that I have used before, especially online editors. The autocomplete
  prety much puts it over the top for me.

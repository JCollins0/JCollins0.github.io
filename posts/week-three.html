<h3 class="question">What did I do this past week?</h3>

<div class="answer">
  This past week I spent a lot of time on all of my Computer Science class
  projects. Especially I spent a lot of time debugging my Lexical Analyzer's
  floating point conversion. It was pretty difficult, but I managed to figure it
  out, though probably not in the cleanest of ways. I also finished the Collatz
  project, doing the workflow, optimizing, etc.
</div>

<h3 class="question">What's in my way?</h3>

<div class="answer">
  I still continue to have procrastination issues. I also recently discovered a
  small leak under my sink that may have been leaking for a while. I'm not sure
  if maintainence will even be able to fix it any time soon.
  Oh the wonders of living in an apartment in West Campus.
</div>

<h3 class="question">What will I do next week?</h3>

<div class="answer">
  This next week I will focus on updating my resume to get ready for the CNS
  Career Fair on Thrusday. I will need to update my resume quite a bit which
  will probably take a few days to get it the way I want it, but it will be
  worth it when I hopefully get an interview. I will also start studying for my
  Interest Theory exam by doing practice problems from the textbook. Financial
  terms and formulas are not my expertice so it will take me a while to get to
  know all of the formulas and what they mean.
</div>

<h3 class="question">What's my experience with the in class exercises?</h3>

<div class="answer">
  In my opinion, the in class exercises help me with problem solving and
  debugging that will be useful for exams. It also helps to learn conventional
  ways of doing things in industry as well as practical uses. I enjoy problem
  solving and doing it in groups in class allow me to communicate ideas more
  effectively than if I were to do it alone.
</div>

<h3 class="question">What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h3>

<div class="answer">
  My tip of the week is to start EARLY on assignments even if you think that
  the project will be easy, it is best to get a head start in case other things
  pop up or unexpected bugs that occur. I know that with Career Fair coming up
  I will have to push aside some projects, so getting an early start will
  prevent me from pushing it aside.

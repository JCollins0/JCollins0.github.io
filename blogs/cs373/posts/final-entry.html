  <h3 class="question">What did you like the least about the class?</h3>

  <div class="answer">
    Although I like the class a lot, I felt the project topic was too narrow
    which caused the presentations to be quite monotonous. The requirements
    for the project were fine, it just felt kind of forced upon us instead of
    taking our own creative thoughts. I probably am not really explaining very
    well what I mean, so sorry about that.
  </div>

  <h3 class="question">What did you like the most about the class?</h3>

  <div class="answer">
    I like a lot of things about the class, but probably the thing that I
    like the most about the class was the Lectures. This was one of the most
    engaging CS classes that I have taken at UT. Downing has so much knowledge
    about what he's teaching and the cold calling keeps everyone in class on
    their toes. Although I never took notes, I learned a lot just from listening
    in class.
  </div>

  <h3 class="question">What's the most significant thing you learned?</h3>

  <div class="answer">
    The most significant thing that I learned in this class was mainly Python
    generators. I had never even heard of them before and they are so so useful.
    Another significant thing that I learned was SQL. Databases are very powerful
    and querying them is even more powerful and useful for large amounts of data
    retrieval. I had also never really dealt with any SQL before so it was
    suprising to me how easy it was to pick up.
  </div>

  <h3 class="question">How many hours a week did you spend coding/debugging/testing for this class?</h3>

  <div class="answer">
    My group was the type of group to procrastinate until the weekend before
    the project was due, so while I did not do a bunch of programming throughout
    the week. I spent quite a long time on the weekends working on React code
    for our frontend website, sometimes even getting into 3am in the morning
    not realizing what time it was.
  </div>

  <h3 class="question">How many hours a week did you spend reading/studying for this class?</h3>

  <div class="answer">
    To be honest, I never did any of the readings. I only realy 'studied' by
    creating a review sheet for the exam usually a few days before the exams.
    I can ususaly just listen, learn, and understand CS topics pretty easily
    so I don't need to study too hard usually.
  </div>

  <h3 class="question">How many lines of code do you think you wrote?</h3>

  <div class="answer">
    I would say that I've probably written somewhere around 2000 lines of code.
  </div>

  <h3 class="question">What required tool did you not know and now find very useful?</h3>

  <div class="answer">
    If React is considered a tool then I would say that React is a very good
    javascript framework to build dynamic websites.
  </div>

  <h3 class="question">What's the most useful Web dev tool that your group used that was not required?</h3>

  <div class="answer">
    I used the Advanced Rest Client as a way of viewing Restful API requests
    easier than from the console. It wasn't necessarily a web dev tool, but
    it was used in our data collection phase that made everything easier.
  </div>

  <h3 class="question">If you could change one thing about the course, what would it be?</h3>
    If I could change one thing about the course I would add a small unit on
    React just becuase if someone has never used it before it could be a big
    knowledge gap for them to start immediately using that on the project.

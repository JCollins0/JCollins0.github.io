<h3 class="question">What did I do this past week?</h3>

<div class="answer">
  This past week in class we talked about generators in python. I think
  generators are amazing. With O(1) creation complexity, generators actually
  are a smart way of saying "I want to do use this formula but not actually
  compute anything yet". I also worked a lot on project #2 with my group and
  cut it close to the 10pm due date, but we got it done.
</div>

<h3 class="question">What's in my way?</h3>

<div class="answer">
  Now that the semester has progressed, some of the work in my classes is
  getting more complicated, except for Programming for Correctness/Performance:
  if you're in that class you know what I'm talking about. The SWE project
  is a lot of work working with tools I've never used before and requires
  collaboration and compromise. Trying to balance that with the fact that
  the compilers project has got me using YACC with C to build a parser, which, I
  had to figure out how to get YACC to output build messages because printf was
  not working when there was an error... Just like OS all over again.
</div>

<h3 class="question">What will I do next week?</h3>

<div class="answer">
  Next week I will be working on my phase 2 of the SWE project with my group,
  hopefully making progress towards better organization and job assignments. I'm
  also hoping to hear back from a couple of companies about whether or not I get
  an interview. In addition on Thursday, I'm planning on seeing Jurassic World
  Fallen Kingdom at the Union which should be fun.
</div>

<h3 class="question">What was your experience of Project #2?</h3>

<div class="answer">
  The project gave me a real taste of what working in a group is going to be
  like throughout the semester. I found that collaborating on slack was really
  easy, although it's no discord. I found the project was quite rushed for only
   having a week to do it, but I'm glad we get a month before the next phase is
   due. I know people were asking for extensions on Piazza, but in the real
   world there may not be the ability for an extension, so we just have to learn
   to complete the project within the given time frame and get it done whatever
   it takes.
</div>

<h3 class="question">What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h3>
  My pick-of-the-week is <a href="https://winscp.net/">WinSCP</a>.
  WinSCP is a file transfer tool that uses SSH connections and allows you to
  access the remote file system. It is very similar to the sshfs linux package.
  The default editor that WinSCP comes with is similar to notepad, but
  you can change that to allow you to open the files in any editor that you
  want. For me that's Atom and it works great; I can have syntax highlighting
  and formatting and then Ctrl+S to save it on the remote server.

<h3 class="question">What did I do this past week?</h3>

<div class="answer">
  This past week I took two exams and got an A on both of them suprisingly.
  I also worked long hours on the SWE project which is consuming most of my time.
  In class we talked about natural join. I like that we implemented it in Python
   and that it only took about 2 lines of code to produce. I love Python for that
   reason that we can simplify massive amounts of code in another language in
   just a few lines.

<h3 class="question">What's in my way?</h3>

<div class="answer">
  Not much has changed since last week. I still am very busy and feel very
  stressed out right now.
  My Interest Theory class is still hard, I can't quite wrap my head
  around what information the word problem is giving me. In class and in the
  textbook we don't do as difficult problems as the Quest homework so it is
  really frustrating when I cant figure out what to do for a problem.
  Annuities are very hard to grasp for me.
  I also push a lot of things back because I have two tests this week so I'm
  behind quite a bit especially for this SWE project.
  Hopefully things will get better when I can figure out how to manage my time.

<h3 class="question">What will I do next week?</h3>

<div class="answer">
  Next week I will be celebrating when our group finishes Phase II of the project.
  There is so much to that we have to do still. I'm not even really sure what the
  unit testing is even supposed to comprise of.

<h3 class="question">What did you think of the talk by Dr. Rich and Dr. Cline?</h3>

<div class="answer">
  I thought that Dr. Rich and Dr. Cline's talk was very interesting. I thought
  it was a little frustrating when they said there was no clear cut way to solve
  any ethical issue, it all depends on what the situation is and there could
  be multiple ways of looking at the situation which makes it even more difficult.
  I've seen them on the course schedule a few times and I kind of want to take
  a class from them if I can.

<h3 class="question">If you went, what did you think of the talk by Atlassian?</h3>

<div class="answer">
  Unfortunately I could not attend the Atlassian talk because I was working on
  the project. :(
</div>

<h3 class="question">What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h3>

<div class="answer">
  My pick-of-the-week is React.js. What an amazing thing to have been created.
  It makes web design a piece of cake, except for CSS of course that is still
  a lot of messy properties that don't really affect what the sound like they
  should affect. React is like java in my opinion because you have classes,
  variables and functions, it just renders html instead of performing computations.
  I love it and you should too.

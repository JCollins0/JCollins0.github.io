<h3 class="question">What did I do this past week?</h3>

<div class="answer">
  This past week I worked very extensively on the SWE project in the early half
  of the week. In the latter half I was relaxing and watching Netflix to cool
  my brain off after so much thinking and frustration. I also got my test results
  from last Week and found out that I did really well on them.

<h3 class="question">What's in my way?</h3>

<div class="answer">
  One major thing in my way is not knowing or understanding how to unittest a
  website. I know there are frameworks out there that make testing easy, but I
  just don't understand what to test and why would we test it. I also have to
  start cooking more food for myself as I have not really been cooking at all
  and thus my food choices have devolved to mostly snacks. It is not a good
  thing to just snack all of the time, so I have to be more strict with myself
  and not snack a lot.

<h3 class="question">What will I do next week?</h3>

<div class="answer">
  Next week I will be working on cleaning up the look (CSS) of our website
  and maybe spicing up the Models page to make it more visually appealing.
  I will also be doing more unit-testing with the site and implementing the
  searching and sorting/filtering react components (or at least figuring it out).
  I will also be finishing up my compilers parser which I know is going to be
  a lot of work. It is frustrating only because there is not enough information
  given to solve the problem effectively and it's mostly a bunch of testing an
   thinking if it looks right...

<h3 class="question">What was your experience of Project #3? </h3>

<div class="answer">
  I actually had a lot of fun with project #3. Even though my group almost
  waited until last minute, we still managed to get everything done on time.
  I had never used ReactJS before this project, and now, I absolutely love it.
  I had also never used databases at all before this project and I found that
  SQLAlchemy is just magic and abstracts a lot of the database intrinsics.
  Design is still not my best attribute, so although the website does not look
  that great, its mechanics are really clean.
</div>

<h3 class="question">What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h3>

<div class="answer">
  My pick of the week is Netflix. Want a way to relax after completing a hard
  project? Is the weather bad outside? Is it late at night? If you answered
  yes to any of the above questions, then Netflix is for you. I have been
  watching netflix a lot recently and really like it. I even like that it
  recommends other shows to watch related to the shows that I've watched
  previously.

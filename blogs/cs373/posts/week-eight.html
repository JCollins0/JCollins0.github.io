<h3 class="question">What did I do this past week?</h3>

<div class="answer">
  This past week I took the first SWE exam and 2nd Programming for Correctness
  exam. In class we talked about database functions: select, and
  project. I like that we implemented them in Python and that it only took
  about 2 lines of code per function. I love Python for that reason that we
  can simplify massive amounts of code in another language in just a few lines.

<h3 class="question">What's in my way?</h3>

<div class="answer">
  Not much has changed since last week. I still am very busy and feel very
  stressed out right now.
  My Interest Theory class is still hard, I can't quite wrap my head
  around what information the word problem is giving me. In class and in the
  textbook we don't do as difficult problems as the Quest homework so it is
  really frustrating when I cant figure out what to do for a problem.
  Annuities are very hard to grasp for me.
  I also push a lot of things back because I have two tests this week so I'm
  behind quite a bit especially for this SWE project.
  Hopefully things will get better when I can figure out how to manage my time.

<h3 class="question">What will I do next week?</h3>

<div class="answer">
  Next week I will be working exstensivly on the SWE project. We have to do
  quite a bit of work (all of it basically). I also have to study for my
  compilers exam so that I have some idea of what's going on. After
  my exams are over I plan to relax a bit and rest my brain. I also plan on
  seeing Incredibles 2 at the union on Thursday.

<h3 class="question">What was your experience of Test #1 (the problems, the time, HackerRank)</h3>

<div class="answer">
  I love HackerRank just for the fact that it has an internal code editor with
  semi-autocomplete. I felt the exam was really really easy the problems weren't
  that difficult and I like that some built upon other problems so that it
  didn't fell like I was writing a whole ton of code. I finished in 20
  minutes at a exam that was alloted 1 hr and 30 minutes.
</div>

<h3 class="question">What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h3>

<div class="answer">
  My tip-of-the-week is don't be like me and procrastinate or fall asleep in
  class. Be a good student who pays attention and takes notes and gets things
  done early. I realize I need to change my ways, but it is very hard for me.

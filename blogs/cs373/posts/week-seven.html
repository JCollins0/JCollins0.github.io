<h3 class="question">What did I do this past week?</h3>

<div class="answer">
  This past week in class we talked about function parameter passing, unpacking
  and packing. I thought it was really neat that python had ways of specifying
  a parameter by name instead of just by position. I think that makes it useful
  to not have to remember what order the parameters are passed, but the name of
  the parameter that is passed. I also had an on campus Interview which I was
  really excited for. I also saw Jurassic World fallen kingdom at the Union

<h3 class="question">What's in my way?</h3>

<div class="answer">
  My Interest Theory class is getting harder, I can't quite wrap my head
  around what information the word problem is giving me. In class and in the
  textbook we don't do as difficult problems as the Quest homework so it is
  really frustrating when I cant figure out what to do for a problem. I also
  push a lot of things back because I have two tests this week so I'm behind
  quite a bit. Hopefully things will get better when I can figure out how to
  manage my time.

<h3 class="question">What will I do next week?</h3>

<div class="answer">
  Next week I will be working on my fourth compilers project. I have to do quite
  a bit of work to create the next parse tree so wish me luck. I also have to
  talk with my group to determine what needs to be done with our project. After
  this exam we should have time to talk and discuss about the next steps. After
  seeing my score for project #2, I want to not wait for the last minute so that
  we can make sure that we have everything that we need for our project.

<h3 class="question">What was your experience of learning the basics of Python?</h3>

<div class="answer">
  I really loved going in depth in Python. I had written some python code before
  but it probably wasn't the best I could have written had I known about
  generators or function packing/unpacking or comprehensions. It was actually
  kind of nostalgic because learning all of these intricacies made it seem like
  the UIL tests back in high-school but just for Python.

<h3 class="question">What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h3>

<div class="answer">
  My pick-of-the-week is the <a href="">Chic-fil-A One App</a>. If you didn't
  know the Chic-fil-A on MLK gives away free food on the app all the time.
  If you love Chic-fil-A like me then you will want to use this app. I have
  gotten so much free food from them, plus if you mobile order you get even
  more free food.

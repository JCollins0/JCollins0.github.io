<h3 class="question">What did I do this past week?</h3>

<div class="answer">
  This past week in class we talked about refactoring in java by using class Class
  to create instances of classes. I had never really used that functionality in
  Java before so it was really interesting to learn about. I also had never
  used streams in Java before which make code really readable from what I've seen.
  I also went apartment hunting with my roommate to find a place for the 2019-20
  school year. In addition I worked on my compilers code generator and the SWE
  visualizations for our site and the providers site.

<h3 class="question">What's in my way?</h3>

<div class="answer">
  I have a cough that has lasted for about two weeks. It is good at times, but
  really bad at some times. I have invested in cough drops and other vitamins
  and have been eating a lot of oranges but it seems I just cannot shake this
  cough. D3 has also been a struggle for me as I really don't understand all
  of the minute details about how d3 work, so our visualizations are very basic.

<h3 class="question">What will I do next week?</h3>

<div class="answer">
  Next week I will be presenting with my group the SWE project. I will also be
  hosting part of a progressive dinner next Friday with my church, so a lot of
  cleaning and cooking. I will also be working on my compilers code generator
  to finish it up and get it all working. I guess I should also start
  'studying' for the SWE exam next monday.

<h3 class="question">If you went, what did you think of the talk by Google?</h3>

<div class="answer">
  I honestly thought the talk by Google was not really that worth going to.
   Maybe a few of the things they said were important like getting more
   women into leadership roles. The conversation I felt was too focused on their
   personal lives which was very specific to them and almost to me felt a little
   too personal to be asked. This is just my opinion.
</div>

<h3 class="question">What was your experience of the refactoring topics?</h3>

<div class="answer">
  Refactoring is a useful thing for making the code simpler and the mindset
  that Downing has put into our heads about not changing the test cases is
  something that I had never really thought of before. I liked learning about
  the intricacies of Java that I had never really touched on before.
</div>

<h3 class="question">What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h3>

<div class="answer">
  My tip-of-the-week is to not blow off the last week of school. A lot of our
  grade is still yet to be determined, so don't slack off yet. Even when you
  feel like you don't want to do work, you have to persevere.

<h3 class="question">What did I do this past week?</h3>

<div class="answer">
  This past week I found my group for the big group project, and we discussed
  many ideas for what our project should be. I also took 2 exams, both of which
  I felt I did pretty well on. I did my first hackerrank coding challenge for
  a company and it went very smoothly, one problem took me 10 minutes while the
  other took me 90. On friday I also attended the Under Armor talk and learned
  the importance of state driven development as opposed to adding a bunch of
  boolean variables to code.

<h3 class="question">What's in my way?</h3>

<div class="answer">
  The SWE project is one big thing that I find will be hard for me, time
  management wise. I know meeting with the group is very important, but I feel
  like with everyone's busy schedule we won't be able to make that happen.
  Another thing in my way is learning javascript. For this project I will
  probably need to learn javascript and various js frameworks if I want to help
  on the frontend; we haven't really decided what areas of the site we each would
  focus on, but just in case.

<h3 class="question">What will I do next week?</h3>

<div class="answer">
  Next week I will be working on my third compilers project. I only have ten
  days to do it, so hopefully it is not that difficult. I also have to meet
  with my group to determine what still needs to be done with our project.
  I am also planning to attend a Beto rally this next week, which I know will
  be very crowded. I also really want to see Hereditary at the Union because
  one of my friends over the summer told me it was a pretty good movie.
</div>

<h3 class="question">What's your experience of the readings, so far?</h3>

<div class="answer">
  To be honest I kind of skim through the readings, but they are helpful,
  interesting tidbits that talk about real life and what it's like in industry.
  I found the Under Armor talk very interesting and I like that they used
  example code in their presentation to get across their point of state
  driven development. In my opinion seeing code is far better than just talking
  about it and hoping everyone understands what you're talking about.
</div>

<h3 class="question">What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h3>

<div class="answer">
  My pick of the week is <a href="https://calendar.google.com/">Google Calendar</a>.
  I use Google Calendar for any and all of my events. It keeps me organized, and
  is especially nice with my Pixel phone as it shows my next/current event
  at the top of my home/lock screen which is good for an at a glance. They recently
  revamped their web UI to look more like the app, so it is very clean.

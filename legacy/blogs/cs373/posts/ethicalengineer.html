<h3 class="question">I am responding to the prompt <b>The Suggestion Box</b></h3>

<div class="answer">
If my boss were to come to me as the systems administrator to find out who
stated in the anonymous suggestion box that "every 10th part I turn out is
defective", I would surely be faced with a dilema. Do I do what is morally
right for the people who buy the defective products or do I do what is right
and protect the identity of the person who wrote the comment since this was
supposed to be an anonymous suggestion box. This to me is very similar to the
ethical dilema brought up in the trolley problem where you can either kill one
person that you love or sacrifice 3+ people that you don't even know. The
posibility for me to make a clear cut decision is impossible give only the
information provided in the original problem statement. Some additional
information that might be useful to help me answer the question is what are the
consequences of not complying. Am I going to get fired, are other people going
to get fired, is there going to be a massive 'witch hunt' lookng for the one
who made the statement. If I were risking being fired, could I find another job
to support myself, or am I reliant on this current job as systems administrator.
Other questions I have are: how serious was the person
who made the statment, it could have been a joke or prank. I feel there should
be a statment put out to the company addressing the statement made before any
action is taken to see if the person who made the statment will come forward
on his own without having to invade the privacy of someone. Why did this person
make this statement and what were the events that could have led to this person
making these statements. Is it something that could have been avoidable.
 Even given this
extra information I would probably still be conflicted. Making choices is
a very hard thing to do. It happens every day at every second of our lives, yet
it is still hard to do in certain situations.
If I had to make a clear cut decision I would probably do nothing and say to my
boss that is against my moral views to out someone for speaking their mind as
you allowed them to. This type of scenario is ironically what led to my computer
archetecture class' piazza to be filled with random meme posts instead of
useful questions because the posts were anonymous to everyone including the professor.
This type of situation actually pops up more than I thought in real life and is
something that I will continue to think about for the rest of my career. Ethics
was not really something I thought about when I first got into computer science
and was not something that I thought about when I got to UT. In several of
my classes we have talked about ethics and I know I will take more classes that
talk about ethics. I need to internalize the ethics viewpoint in all that i do
to continue to think about ethics in my future job and in life in general.

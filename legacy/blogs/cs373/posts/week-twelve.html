<h3 class="question">What did I do this past week?</h3>

<div class="answer">
  This past week I worked on completing the frontend for our SWE project. It
  didn't take very long and I was happy about that because I also had a compilers
  project that I needed to do and I had put off working on it for a week. Luckily
  I finished my compilers parser on saturday after I had left it seg-faulting
  last tuesday. It was a pain in the butt to debug but I eventually found my
  issue and continued to work diligently.

<h3 class="question">What's in my way?</h3>

<div class="answer">
  Not a lot in my way. I am starting to feel slugish though and have a slight
  headache. I feel that the weather flip flopping back and forth from hot to
  cold is not doing so well for my health. I finished all of my projects that
  were due before the break so as for right now I'm chilling out and having
  an easy slide into the week. Something that I am now starting to realize is
  that this blog is constantly something that I dread having to write. I don't
  really know why, because I like writing down my thoughts and summaries of my
  week. I just feel that because I'm being forced it's less fun. I would love
  to continue to write blogs in the future but I find that my laziness
  would prevent me from really getting into it.

<h3 class="question">What will I do next week?</h3>

<div class="answer">
  Next week I will not be focused on school at all. I will be driving home on
  Wednesday unless my classes on Tuesday are cancelled. Hopefully the drive
  doesn't involve a lot of traffic since I'll be driving to Houston on 290.
  I am looking forward to seeing my family again an eating some delicious home
  cooked food (as opposed to ramen).

<h3 class="question">What was your experience of Project #4?</h3>

<div class="answer">
  Since in our project we were doing a lot of computation in the backend, we
  found a way to implement searching, sorting,filtering completely in the
  backend with only a few minor changes to the frontend. Overall this phase
  was not a lot of work for me. We managed to get it all done in just a few days.
</div>

<h3 class="question">What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h3>

<div class="answer">
  My tip-of-the-week is to go home relax and enjoy the break while you can
  because as soon as you come back school is going to hit you like a truck
  with the next phase of IDB due that tuesday. Eat a lot of turkey get nice and
  plump and forget the worries of school. Leave school for school!

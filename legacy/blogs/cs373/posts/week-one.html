<h3 class="question">What are my expectations of the class?</h3>
<div class="answer">
  I expect to learn a lot about working in a team with this course as well as
  learning new software development workflows and tools especially Javascript,
  SQL, and python. Even if I may never use the tools we use in this class,
  I think it will be worthwhile to learn new things.
</div>

<h3 class="question">What did I do this past week?</h3>
<div class="answer">
  In class on Wednesday, Downing had us introduce ourselves to our neighbors and
  draw a picture of them. We then went over usual first day syllabus things. On
  friday we talked about Docker, an easy tool to setup development environmnets
  which I thought was really fascinating. I had never really heard of Docker
  before then.

<h3 class="question">What's in my way?</h3>
<div class="answer">
  One big thing in my way is living far away from campus. With a twenty minute
  walk or fifteen minute bus ride forces me to wake up earlier than from when I
  lived on campus. Other than that I would say that having three CS classes is
  also going to be a struggle with homework, projects, etc. for each class.
  Finally making this website by hand without templates is very difficult,
  but doable.
</div>

<h3 class="question">What will I do next week?</h3>
<div class="answer">
  Next week I will probably get together with my team and discuss what need to
  do to be successful in the class and also setup meeting times to work. I hope
  that next week we will be given the project that we will start to work on, so
  that my group can start to discuss. I will probably also start reading some
  of the textbook chapters to get a more firm understanding of the material.
</div>

<h3 class="question">What's my experience with the class?</h3>
<div class="answer">
I like the idea of "Cold-Calling" which aides in the interaction between
professor and student and forces participation as well as the conversation that
Downing has with the student that is called on. I have never had a class do that
before so I am intereseted in seeing how it plays out throughout the semester.
</div>

<h3 class="question">What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h3>
<div class="answer">
My pick-of-the-week is <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a>. It is the code
editor made by Github, so it interacts nicely there, and has many plugins that
are useful. I am using atom to write this blog currently and have used it in
many other CS classes as a universal text editor.

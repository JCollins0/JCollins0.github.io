<h3 class="question">What did I do this past week?</h3>

<div class="answer">
  This past week I worked very extensively on the SWE project in the early half
  of the week. In the latter half I was relaxing and watching Netflix to cool
  my brain off after so much thinking and frustration. I also started working
  on my compilers project which is still in progress. I also went to see
  'Sorry to Bother You' at the union. It was a very interesting movie that
  had a larger meaning than all of the literal randomness that was present in
   the movie. I also got a job offer from Visa, so I'm really happy.

<h3 class="question">What's in my way?</h3>

<div class="answer">
  One major thing in my way is not knowing or understanding how to unittest a
  website. I know there are frameworks out there that make testing easy, but I
  just don't understand what to test and why would we test it. I still also have to
  start cooking more food for myself as I have not really been cooking at all
  and thus my food choices have devolved to mostly snacks. It is not a good
  thing to just snack all of the time, so I have to be more strict with myself
  and not snack a lot. Another thing in my way is dealing with time management
  with 3 separate projects going on.

<h3 class="question">What will I do next week?</h3>

<div class="answer">
  Next week I will be working on adding searching/sorting/filtering to our website
  and maybe spicing up the Models page to make it more visually appealing.
  I will also be doing more unit-testing with the site and implementing the
  I will also be working on my compilers parser which I know is going to be
  a lot of work. It is frustrating not only because there is not enough information
  given to solve the problem effectively and it's mostly a bunch of testing an
   thinking if it looks right, but also because my program seg-faults every other
   time I edit and run it which is very frustrating to track down the source of.

<h3 class="question">What was your experience in learning SQL?</h3>

<div class="answer">
  I actually had a lot of fun learning SQL. I never really knew about databases
  before, and now I have a lot of respect for them in how powerful database
  queries are. A lot of the queries are basically in plain english so a WYSIWYG
  style declarative language makes it really easy to generate queries. The hard
  part is knowing all of the vocabulary and knowing what the results of subqueries
  are and how subqueries work and what all is compatible with other commands.

<h3 class="question">What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h3>

<div class="answer">
  My pick of the week is Matlab. I know a lot of people hate on Matlab, including
  me, but it does have some perks. The only thing I find useful is matrix/vector
  operations and graphing. Matlab matricies can be declared almost like 2D arrays
  and there are built in functions for inverses and even a simple symbol ' which
  it uses for transpose. I do have some downsides though with Matlab. One especially
  painful thing is that array indexing starts at 1 which just kills me. I know
  that the things I'm describing are just scratching the surface of Matlab, but
  until I actually care to dive deeper these are my opinions.
